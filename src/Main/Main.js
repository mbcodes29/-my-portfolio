                I have an interest in tech, video games, film, and art in a variety of mediums. My main career goals are developing and improving apps and software that encourage cultivating new and creative ideas, designing websites that are informative, aesthetically pleasing, and user-friendly, and collaborating and foster productive friendships with other like-minded developers and creatives in tech. Although I do a great job working solo, I love collaborating with other programmers and would love the opportunity to join another team that likes to code as much as I do.

                If you're a prospective client who would like someone to create a website for yourself or your company, code a game or design characters for that video game project that has been rolling around in your head for a while, or if you need a talented programmer who can help your app really take off, I'd love to hear from you!
