                I've always loved computers and from the moment I built my first desktop computer at age 15, I knew that I wanted a career in technology in some capacity. I took classes in Information Technology and dabbled in coding, but I wasn't sure what exactly I wanted to do with that knowledge.

                After learning more about CSS and designing themes for Tumblr, I decided that I'd like to do something that would allow me to pursue my interests in technology and design as well, so being a software developer was a great fit.

                Although I do a great job working solo, I love collaborating with other programmers and would love the opportunity to join another team that likes to code as much as I do.

                If you're a prospective client who would like someone to create a website for yourself or your company, create characters for that video game plot that has been rolling around in your head for a while, or if you need a talented programmer who can help your app really take off, I'd love to hear from you!
